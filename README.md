Final Projects
In Sprint 6 you will do your final projects and really stretch your developer muscles. This is a great and fun opportunity to really experiment with the tools you've got and deep-dive into the parts that you would like to practice more. The objective with the projects is to wrap up everything you have learnt during the program and to build one bigger application. 

Brief

This is your project. You choose yourself what to build and how. 

A good plan, however, is to make sure what you build can be deployed online so that you can show your project in the future. Meaning don't use closed API's, don't make secret projects for companies etc. 

Scope

The scope of the project should be two weeks full-time and you will get help and advice to determine the scope with a coach.
